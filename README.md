# shopping-behavior

Using a sample dataset of aggregate descriptive statistics and visualizations on American consumers, identify the seasonity of shoppers, demographics that buy the most, and market outreach strategies that can maximize purchses.

## Observations 

To complete this project, I broke up each part into smaller sections and completed those smaller sections over various days, pausing for parts that were more difficult. The initial visualizations did fall in line with my assumptions about the typical shopper and their habits. The only visualizations that confused me were in regards to "Purchase Amount (USD)" and "Review Rating", where what initially appears to be missing data is explained by further analysis. Using a T-test we can see that promo codes do cause people to spend more money, explaining the bimodal distribution in the "Purchase Amount (USD)" histogram. Through anecdotal evidence and personal experience, I can attest that getting a discount on a purchase causes people to spend more to compensate for it, negating the discount by either spending an amount equal to or greater than the pre-discount price. I believe a good next step for this conclusion is figuring out if the size of the discount from the promo code affects the purchase size and by how much.
